## Notes

Implemented the code base using create-react-app.

Added node-sass npm module for scss stylesheet.

Added react-ellipsis-text and react-responsive-carousel for implementing Carousel and Ellipsis text.

Used BEM for scss styling.

Getting error when making API call: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource", so I added chrome extension in order to fetch API data.

The Dishwasher price block is added twice to make it hidden and visible according to Landscape and Portrait mode designs.
